## Room for Improvement

- It will be nice, to extend our project to all football leagues in Europe. 
- For better security, we can change the way of storing users sensitive data, by sending it to SQL database instead of simple .txt file.
- Instead of loading all images locally, we can get it from [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com) by sending request while starting the app.
